# My Mancala App implemenation
This documentation is to keep track of major decisions taken during implementation

## Frameworks and technologies
The decisions for the frameworks and technologies to be considered during development are outlined below:
- [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html): For base development, would consider upgrading to Kotlin in the future
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org): Useful plugins outlined in POM configuration; review for more info
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli): Angular 13 to be used, would upgrade if later version is released during development
- [H2 Database](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html): Using a volatile data storage for demo purposes; will consider alternatives for full scale production environments
- [STOMP Messaging](https://stomp.github.io/): Utilizing web socket via STOMP messaging with Spring to create a real-time interactive web application
- [Facade Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern): Facade design pattern to abstract Mancala as an entity on its own and provide an avenue for addition of new game components


## Base Project Structure
Mancala is a basic count-and-capture board game played using stones or seeds as playing pieces with
holes in the board used as holding pits. 
First consideration in project design is identifying the entities that will make up the system.
### The Entities
The major components that make up the same are described below:
- Game: This contains description about the type of game, status, result and winner
- Player: This contains description about the player, who the person is and how he can be uniquely identified
####
We can further break this down further by using facade pattern design to personalize what type of game is played at the time,
identify that as an entity and further break it down to smaller components.
#### Base entity design
Since we've identified the base entities as player and game, we would start with the first two tables with their corresponding name.  
####
For the player entity, we have the table name as `players` and  we have the following attributes: `playerId`, `playerEmail`, and `playerName`. 
The attribute `playerId` is the primary key of the entity table and it has the annotation:
```sh
 @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
```
because we want it autogenerated. Both the `playerEmail`, and `playerName` are set to be not nullable and the `playerEmail` attribute is unique
####
For the game entity, we have the table name as `game` and  we have the following attributes: `gameId`, `gameType`, `state`, `winner`, and `gameResult`.
The attribute `gameId` is the primary key of the entity table however it is not autogenerated because we have other plans on uniquely generating the gameId.
Also, the `winner` attribute is a join column to the Player table using the Player primary key as an identifier.
